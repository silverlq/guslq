            "commentary":"This is the first complete game I ever made and shared with friends. I was 12 years old at the time when it was finished. It is heavily inspired on games I enjoyed playing at the time, namely Final Fantasy VII and Legend of Legaia. The majority of the game logic was built-in to the game engine on which this was created, RPG Maker 2003. Most of the assets are default graphics and audio from that engine, although I modified all the graphics for the main characters in MS Paint to customize them. This little gem will always hold a special place in my heart. I remember the day when I brought it to school in a CD so that my friends could play, and the happiness I felt when they told me how they enjoyed it.",

            "commentary":"This is the first complete game I ever programmed. Although I did not know how to code back then, I programmed this and many other games around that time using visual scripting (drag-and-drop logic nodes). Even though I enjoyed Japanese RPGs, which could be easily made in RPG Maker, I craved being able to make different styles of games. For this reason I moved on to Game Maker, a much more versatile game engine with a much steeper learning curve.  This game marks the first major milestone in my learning to program software.",
